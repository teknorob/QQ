##Cry me a shower

This is a Queueing System for simple things like a shower or kitchen fairy duties and shit.
Makes shit easier cause of sms' through TWILIO and shit. No more cutting down trees for shit like that.
No more walking back and forth and shit to check if people are in the shower.
No more getting shitty with people cutting the queue and shit.

Get this shit through a proxy?
gradle -PproxyHost=<proxyhostaddress> -PproxyPort=<proxyPort> run
