QQ
=====
This is in pre-alpha and completely unfinished.. don't bother trying to use it just yet

This is a Queueing System for simple things like a shower or kitchen fairy duties or whatever.
Makes shit easier cause of sms' through TWILIO and shit. No more cutting down trees for shit like that.
No more walking back and forth and shit to check if people are in the shower.
No more getting shitty with people cutting the queue and shit.

Set up your proxy, google client id, and service account password in the qq_config file
resources/com/qq/config/qq_config.json

Set up a twilio account in the twilio_config file
